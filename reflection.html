                        <h1>My Journey</h1>
                        <p>As many have expressed, this class has caused me to reconsider the way that I approach my learning.  With the freedom we are given to learn at our own pace, comes the responsibility to do so.</p>
                        <p>In this presentation I will try to address the many ways I have changed as a result of this journey.  The bulk of my insights in this presentation come from weekly reflection of my experiences in and outside of class.</p>

                    <h1>Classroom Collaboration</h1>
                    <p>At the beginning of the semester we had a classroom discussion where one of the TA's brought up the fact that we should be collaborating as a class. He suggested that we use the presentations to not only show what we had learned but to teach the other teams inthe class.</p>
                    <p>The first technology my team decided to learn was GIT. I had been thinking about the purpose of the class and while driving home one day I sat pondering how I could better help my team to understand some of these concepts. I had a thought that although didn't answer my question directly, it would benefit the whole class.  The idea was to make a repository for the whole class to use to share code examples.  This way we could all share code with one another and hopefully benefit form the experience.</p>
                    <p>Looking back on this experience, I regret that it didn't catch on as much as I thought it would.  There were those who thought it was a good idea but it never did see any practical use. If I could go back with my current knowledge of GIT I would have created an organization for the class and asked for all who had GitHub accounts to give me their usernames to add them as collaborators to the organization so that they could create their own repositories in the organization.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Working with my Group</h1>
                <div class='col-xs-6 col-xs-offset-1 well'>
                    <h1>Alone vs. Group</h1>
                    <p>I enjoy working by myself. Being able to set my own deadlines and not having to rely on others to do work appeals to me. On the contrary working alone, I am limited to my own vision and abilities.  So when trying to produce something that requires skills in areas I do not possess, I often am not able to produce the best experience.</p>
                    <p>My experience of working with my group in this class has led me to several conclusions about myself.  First being that I have a hard time working with people that I expect to understand more than they do. I find that when I have to explain things to people that I expect to already understand, I become a bit annoyed. I realized this about halfway through the semester and decided that I needed to be more understanding.  I feel as though through the end of the semester I was able to do much better.</p>
                    <p>The second thing I learned was how easy it is to work in a group when everyone puts in the necessary effort. There was a week where everyone in my group had spent time outside of class learning and trying to understand the technologies.  It made working togethor extremely easy because we were all on the same page. I worked well in this kind of situation and wished that it could have been that way every week. In the workplace I will be working with many people of differing levels</p>
